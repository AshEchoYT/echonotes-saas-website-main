# Icon Files

For the Windows application, you need to place icon files in this directory:

1. **icon.ico** - Windows icon file (256x256 recommended)
2. **icon.png** - PNG version (512x512 recommended)

## How to create proper icons:

### Option 1: Use an online tool
- Visit: https://www.icoconverter.com/
- Upload your PNG logo (512x512 or higher)
- Download the .ico file
- Place it here as `icon.ico`

### Option 2: Use your existing logo
- If you have a logo or icon design, convert it to .ico format
- Recommended sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256

## Temporary Placeholder
Currently using a basic placeholder icon. Replace with your custom EchoNotes logo for production.

The electron app will look for:
- `build/icons/icon.ico` (Windows)
- `build/icons/icon.png` (Generic)
